Before becoming a web-developer, I taught kindergarten children. When Wordle took the world by storm, we included it as a game in our classroom as a treat.
However 6 guess is not enough for a class of 6 year olds to solve Worlde. So I created a Wordle game that allowed an unlimited number of attempts. Also, when creating a World clone, maybe people use APIs to grab a random word. For children this a risky move! So I created a dictionary of 500 child-safe words that can be updated easily. My teacher name at this school was Mr. Sam and so the game was dubbed 'Mr. Samdle'. This game brought so fun to the classroom and also taught my students the value of working together and communicating.
